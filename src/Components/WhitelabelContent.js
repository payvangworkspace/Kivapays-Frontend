        <h1>Branding Customization</h1>
        <p>
        The white label technology is a ready-made licensed software product developed by one company and rebranded by another one, to make it appear their own. The mechanism seems clear, but what does white label mean in business today?
        </p>
        <p>
        In the saturated ad market and high competition environment, it is difficult to stand out from the crowd. The launch of the product will require a lot of efforts and time, even if you’ve progressed far past planning stage. It will take even more time to build your brand recognition and grow a loyal customer base, that’s why marketers invented white label platforms.
        </p>

        Kiva Pays Offers White label solution to all Business owners which allows easy customization of Checkout look-and-feel with your Business logo and brand color.
        </p>
        <p>
        White Label solution requires a minimum of upfront capital investment since the vendor handles all issues with software licensing, data center space or servers, costs on logistics and tech support. After the company customizes the product with the feel and look of their own brand, it can begin selling the product as its own collecting revenues and share the commission with the service provider or technology.
        </p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
        The vendor company develops a “plug-and-play” product for your business, for instance, a white label-advertising platform that’s seamlessly tailored to suit your brand. Then, you have to “decorate” the product to match your corporate identity. With the help of White Label, you can add your company’s name, logo, icons, URLs, corporate emails, components of the text and some elements of the website to align them with your brand comfortably. After full customization, you will be ready to turn your white label sales right away, on your own conditions.
