        <div className="virtual-account-content">
          <p>
            The need for better control and visibility over their cash <strong>INFLOW</strong> and <strong>OUTFLOW</strong>—and 
            liquidity positions—has led corporates to seek smarter transaction banking alternatives like virtual accounts.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            These accounts are used to make and receive payments via <strong>NEFT, RTGS, IMPS</strong> on behalf of one physical account.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Virtual accounts also offer corporates the ability to <strong>reconcile payments in real time</strong>. 
            <strong>Kiva Pays</strong> offers virtual accounts on demand to their corporate clients.

          <ul className="virtual-account-benefits">
            <li>
              Corporates with multiple banking relationships, multiple accounts across different banks, 
              and a need to rationalize complex accounting structures can especially benefit from virtual accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              They can virtually administer inter-company loans, calculate interest, increase cost efficiencies, 
              simplify cash and liquidity management, and increase straight-through processing (STP) rates in reconciliation.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>Virtual Account Management (VAM)</strong> platform can help corporates create, manage, and monitor virtual accounts better.
            </li>
            <li>
              We offer benefits like a self-servicing <strong>VAM engine</strong>, a dashboard view to account information, and a sophisticated reporting module, 
              in addition to payments and liquidity management.
            </li>
            <li>
              VAM platforms can also complicate a bank’s ability to have a single comprehensive view of their customers.
